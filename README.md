 I am Professor of Sociology and University Faculty Scholar at [North Carolina State University](https://chass.ncsu.edu/people/sjmcdona/).
 I study how social networks and social capital provide advantages and disadvantages to individuals in labor markets, in organizations, and across work careers. I am also interested in how internet and computing technologies tend to exacerbate those (dis)advantages. Here are some examples of my recent research. 
 For full details about my research, see my [Google Scholar site](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x5igFpEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
