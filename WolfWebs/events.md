#### Tom R. Leppard, "Givers, Takers, and Reciprocators: Reimagining Individuals and Groups in UK Grime Music"
 - Postdoctoral Fellow, Data Science & AI Academy, North Carolina State University
 - April 4, 2025, 3:00-4:30p, room 129 in the 1911 building
 - Traditional network measures like centrality and brokerage primarily focus on an individual’s position within a network, but they often overlook how that individual is integrated into the broader group. In this talk, I’ll challenge this perspective by reimagining social network structure. Using the familiar concept of reciprocity, I’ll examine how individuals signal their participation in a group and receive validation from it. Drawing on 22 years of collaboration data collected from 122 UK Grime artists, I propose a new way to think about reciprocity as a measure of individual-to-group (artist-to-genre) integration. Grime—a London-based rap genre that emerged from the reggae scene in the early 2000s—has a complex and fluid social structure, driven by both innovative collaboration and intense competition. I argue that this approach offers a deeper understanding of how people contribute to the formation of the Grime genre, shifting the focus from mere connections to the quality of an individual’s integration within the genre’s social and cultural fabric.

#### Peter Ore, "Toward a Social Metrology: Reconciling Quantitative and Interpretive Approaches in the Study of Data"
 - Assistant Professor, Department of Sociology, Queens College in the CUNY
 - April 14, 2025, 3:00-4:30p, room 129 in the 1911 building
 - Increasing numbers of social scientists are now studying "powerful numbers" (Bouk, Ackerman, and boyd 2022). This subfield's contributions have been centered around the interpretation of /numerical data as text/, highlighting dimensions of meaning not accessible through statistical reduction. However, fully realizing this interpretive approach to data implies a need for an ethnomethodology of data, or study of the concrete practice of data production and analysis. This binds the literature in a paradox. Scholars of quantitative reason adopt methodological commitments that imply they should become practitioners of some form of quantitative reasoning, but also prevent them from doing so. In this talk, I show that the quantitative study of quantitative reason is methodologically consistent with interpretive social science. I do so by demonstrating three approaches to meta-quantitative reasoning I label /forensic/, /actuarial/, and /constructivist/. I apply each approach to important moments in the history of air pollution data. In the forensic approach, I replicate and extend computations found in experiments meant to standardize federal "dust counting" instruments in the interwar period. This approach interprets data as a product of social interaction. I demonstrate the actuarial approach by applying anomaly detection algorithms to the United States Air Quality System, then mapping the distribution of anomalies onto the political geography of the United States. This approach interprets data as eventful. I use the constructivist approach to examine the differential mobility of administrative categories used in air pollution data over time. This last approach interprets data as an institutional device. As Duncan (1984: 34) puts it, "all measurement ... is social measurement"; quantification stems from a fundamentally social need for coordination across space and time. As such, quantification cannot be understood unless distant readings are joined with immanent computations. Building a social metrology requires overcoming the methodological antinomies of the 20th century
