### Spring 2026 Speaker Series
#### Néha Gondal, "Rulenet: Mapping Relationships between Cultural and other Variables  using Association-Rules and Network Graphs"
 - Associate Professor, Department of Sociology & Faculty of Computing & Data Sciences, Boston University
 - February 6, 2026, 3-4:30p in room 129 of the 1911 building
 - Sociologists have persuasively argued that cultural meaning can be interpreted by analyzing the systems of relations that measure the so-called ‘going together’ of cultural materials. Research investigating cultural tastes and preferences has used this approach to interpret consumption patterns as relational systems using a variety of techniques including multidimensional scaling, two-mode network analysis, and variable correlation networks. I contribute to this growing set of tools by describing and demonstrating the use of a datamining technique with scant history of use within sociology, called ‘association-rules.’ The key contribution of this technique is that it generates directed relationships between variables (e.g., preference for opera --> preference for ballet), which has several advantages over existing techniques that conceptualize relationality in terms of mutual presence. I show how such ‘one-sided’ clustering (A goes with B, but B may not go together with A) can be represented and analyzed as network graphs, an approach I call ‘Rulenet.’ In this talk, I will discuss how the proposed technique can provide novel insights into the organizations of tastes and outline extensions of the approach to other sociologically relevant domains.

#### Dustin S. Stoltz, "Embeddings as a Generic Method"
 - Assistant Professor, Sociology and Cognitive Science, Lehigh University
 - February 13, 2026, 3-4:30p in room 129 of the 1911 building
 - Word or text embeddings are a central component in modern language models, including those powering generative AI. Embeddings represent some token (typically a word or phrase) as positions in space, where tokens that are closer together are used in similar contexts or evoke similar concepts -- even if those tokens never actually co-occur. Thus, embeddings operationalize "meaning" as fundamentally relational. We can use these embeddings for various downstreams tasks or we can navigate this latent "meaning space" created by embeddings directly using basic arithmetic. In doing so, we can explore how meaning changes overtime or how meaning differs between different collections of texts. We may also generalize "token" beyond words or phrases strictly, and include many collections of co-occuring entities.
